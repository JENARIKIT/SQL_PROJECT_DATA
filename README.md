## Quantity of raw materials consumed:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This metric measures the total amount of raw materials used in the production of wheat flour. It includes all the primary and auxiliary materials required for production.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Monitoring this helps in understanding resource utilization and efficiency. It can also aid in cost management and inventory control.


## Number of products manufactured:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This represents the total count of finished wheat flour products produced during the year.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This metric provides insight into production volume and can help in assessing the capacity and productivity of the manufacturing process.


## Operational time:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This is the total time during which the production equipment and processes are actively producing wheat flour.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tracking operational time helps in evaluating the efficiency of the production process and can highlight areas for improvement in operations.


## Production process downtime:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This measures the total duration when the production process is halted or non-operational, due to maintenance, breakdowns, or other interruptions.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Understanding downtime is crucial for identifying bottlenecks, improving maintenance schedules, and enhancing overall productivity.


## OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) values:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è OEE is a comprehensive metric that combines availability, performance, and quality to measure the overall effectiveness of production equipment.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è High OEE values indicate efficient, high-quality production with minimal downtime, making it a key performance indicator for manufacturing efficiency.


## Performance values:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This refers to the speed at which the production process operates relative to its designed capacity.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Performance values help in understanding how well the production process is performing compared to its potential, highlighting areas for speed and efficiency improvements.


## Quality values:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This metric assesses the proportion of good quality products produced without defects.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Maintaining high quality values ensures that the products meet the required standards and reduces the cost associated with rework or waste.


## Availability values:

Explanation ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Availability measures the proportion of time the production equipment is available for use compared to the planned production time.

Importance ‚ñ∂Ô∏è High availability values indicate that the equipment is reliable and has minimal downtime, which is essential for maintaining continuous production.
